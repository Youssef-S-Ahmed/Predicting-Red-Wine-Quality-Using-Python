# Predicting-Red-Wine-Quality-Using-Python

Project Overview
This repository contains a Python-based machine learning model for predicting the quality of red wine. The model utilizes various physicochemical properties of the wine, such as acidity, sugar content, and alcohol level, to predict its quality rating.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Wine Quality dataset, which is publicly available. It contains information about various physicochemical properties of red wines and their corresponding quality ratings.

Dependencies
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn Â  

Project Structure
data: Contains the dataset file (e.g., winequality-red.csv).
src: Contains the Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
models: Stores trained models.
